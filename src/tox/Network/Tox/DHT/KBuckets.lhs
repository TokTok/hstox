\section{K-buckets}

K-buckets is a data structure for efficiently storing a set of nodes close to a
certain key called the base key.  The base key is constant throughout the
lifetime of a k-buckets instance.

A k-buckets is a map from small integers \texttt{0 <= n < 256} to Client Lists
of maximum size $k$. Each Client List is called a (k-)bucket. A k-buckets is
equipped with a base key, and each bucket has this key as its base key.
\texttt{k} is called the bucket size.  The default bucket size is 8.
A large bucket size was chosen to increase the speed at which peers are found.  

\begin{code}

data KBuckets = KBuckets
  { bucketSize :: Int
  , buckets    :: Map KBucketIndex ClientList
  , baseKey    :: PublicKey
  }
  deriving (Eq, Read, Show)


defaultBucketSize :: Int
defaultBucketSize = 8


empty :: PublicKey -> KBuckets
empty = KBuckets defaultBucketSize Map.empty

\end{code}

The above number \texttt{n} is the bucket index.  It is a non-negative integer
with the range \texttt{[0, 255]}, i.e. the range of an 8 bit unsigned integer.

\begin{code}


newtype KBucketIndex = KBucketIndex Word8
  deriving (Eq, Ord, Read, Show, Num, Binary, Enum)


\end{code}

\subsection{Bucket Index}

The index of the bucket can be computed using the following function:
\texttt{bucketIndex(baseKey, nodeKey) = 255 - log_2(distance(baseKey,
nodeKey))}.  This function is not defined when \texttt{baseKey == nodeKey},
meaning k-buckets will never contain a Node Info about the base node.

Thus, each k-bucket contains only Node Infos for whose keys the following
holds: if node with key \texttt{nodeKey} is in k-bucket with index \texttt{n},
then \texttt{bucketIndex(baseKey, nodeKey) == n}. Thus, n'th k-bucket consists
of nodes for which distance to the base node lies in range
\verb![2^n, 2^(n+1) - 1]!.

The bucket index can be efficiently computed by determining the first bit at
which the two keys differ, starting from the most significant bit.  So, if the
local DHT key starts with e.g. \texttt{0x80} and the bucketed node key starts
with \texttt{0x40}, then the bucket index for that node is 0.  If the second
bit differs, the bucket index is 1.  If the keys are almost exactly equal and
only the last bit differs, the bucket index is 255.

\begin{code}


bucketIndex :: PublicKey -> PublicKey -> Maybe KBucketIndex
bucketIndex pk1 pk2 =
  fmap (\index -> 255 - fromIntegral index) $ Distance.log2 $ Distance.xorDistance pk1 pk2


\end{code}

\subsection{Manipulating k-buckets}

TODO: this is different from kademlia's least-recently-seen eviction policy; why
the existing solution was chosen, how does it affect security, performance and
resistance to poisoning? original paper claims that preference of old live nodes
results in better persistence and resistance to basic DDoS attacks;

Any update or lookup operation on a k-buckets instance that involves a single
node requires us to first compute the bucket index for that node.  An update
involving a Node Info with \texttt{nodeKey == baseKey} has no effect.  If the
update results in an empty bucket, that bucket is removed from the map.

\begin{code}


updateBucketForKey :: KBuckets -> PublicKey -> (ClientList -> ClientList) -> KBuckets
updateBucketForKey kBuckets key f =
  case bucketIndex (baseKey kBuckets) key of
    Nothing    -> kBuckets
    Just index -> updateBucketForIndex kBuckets index f


updateBucketForIndex :: KBuckets -> KBucketIndex -> (ClientList -> ClientList) -> KBuckets
updateBucketForIndex kBuckets@KBuckets { buckets, baseKey, bucketSize } index f =
  let
    -- Find the old bucket or create a new empty one.
    updatedBucket = f $ Map.findWithDefault (ClientList.empty baseKey bucketSize) index buckets
    -- Replace old bucket with updated bucket or delete if empty.
    updatedBuckets =
      if ClientList.isEmpty updatedBucket
      then Map.delete index buckets
      else Map.insert index updatedBucket buckets
  in
  kBuckets { buckets = updatedBuckets }


\end{code}

Adding a node to, or removing a node from, a k-buckets consists of performing
the corresponding operation on the Client List bucket whose index is that of
the node's public key.

A node is considered \textit{viable} for entry to a k-buckets if it is viable
for entry to the corresponding bucket.

\begin{code}

instance NodeList KBuckets where
  addNode time nodeInfo kBuckets =
    updateBucketForKey kBuckets publicKey $ ClientList.addNode time nodeInfo
    where
      publicKey = NodeInfo.publicKey nodeInfo

  removeNode publicKey kBuckets =
    updateBucketForKey kBuckets publicKey $ ClientList.removeNode publicKey

  viable KBuckets{ baseKey, buckets } nodeInfo =
    case bucketIndex baseKey $ NodeInfo.publicKey nodeInfo of
      Nothing    -> False
      Just index -> case Map.lookup index buckets of
        Nothing     -> True
        Just bucket -> ClientList.viable bucket nodeInfo

  nodeListBaseKey = baseKey

\end{code}

Iteration order of a k-buckets instance is in order of distance from the base
key.  I.e. the first node seen in iteration is the closest, and the last node
is the furthest away in terms of the distance metric.

\begin{code}

  traverseClientLists f kBuckets@KBuckets{ buckets } =
    (\x -> kBuckets{ buckets = x }) <$> traverse f (reverseT buckets)
    where
      reverseT :: (Traversable t) => t a -> t a
      reverseT t = snd (mapAccumR (\ (x:xs) _ -> (xs, x)) (toList t) t)

foldNodes :: (a -> NodeInfo -> a) -> a -> KBuckets -> a
foldNodes f x =
  foldl f x
  . concatMap ClientList.nodeInfos
  . reverse . Map.elems . buckets

getAllNodes :: KBuckets -> [NodeInfo]
getAllNodes =
  concatMap ClientList.nodeInfos . Map.elems . buckets


genKBuckets :: PublicKey -> Gen KBuckets
genKBuckets publicKey =
  foldl (flip $ uncurry ClientList.addNode) (empty publicKey) <$> Gen.listOf arbitrary


instance Arbitrary KBuckets where
  arbitrary = arbitrary >>= genKBuckets
\end{code}
